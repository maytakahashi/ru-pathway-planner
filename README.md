# Rutgers Pathway Planner

## Description

It’s difficult to figure out the most efficient way to graduate, since many majors are often complicated by equivalencies, varying credit values, prerequisites, corequisites, and spring-only/fall-only classes. This can lead to missing prerequisites and even delayed graduation for certain students. 

## Solution Requirements

This tool will make it easier for students to plan their schedule by accounting for the various different factors that affect the order and times at which courses can be taken. The tool will output the most efficient graduation schedule and list the necessary courses to be taken. The tool will also account for overlaps between majors. It will reduce the necessity of an advisor and allow more control over a student’s own planning.
